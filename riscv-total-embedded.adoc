== preface

This document uses semantic versioning with respect to potential hardware designs. 
Assembly syntax change is a minor increment. Version 1.0.0 is the first publicly released. 
Changes in prior versions are not versioned properly and not tracked in revision history.

Document is written in a way that reduces the duplications as those are hard to maintain.

== Introduction

Even though the current risc-v "privileged" architecture is great for general unix systems.
It fails to meet many embedded and hard real time requirements.

Instead of adding more and more on top of layered legacy, that leads to silicon waste, let's replace
entire volume II (aka riscv privileged) with minimal yet efficient embedded architecture.

The goal is to achieve interrupt architecture capable of predictable and fast
control loops by providing minimal interrupt latency and jitter. +
Optionally offer single digit cycles of interrupt latency to actual code and true zero jitter,
as to not disturb minimal implementations. +
By leveraging general purpose computing capability of risc-v architecture, we can
avoid the need for separate cores (often with asymetric architectures) to offload 
low priority tasks (communication, HMI etc).

The lack of many "legacy" functionalities allows reduction of silicon area, power, and verification costs. 

=== prior art

A quick recap of what we already have available.

==== cortex-m NVIC

<<armnvic>> defacto established "industry standard" of efficient interrupt handling.
Anyone complaining about risc-v likes and wants the NVIC.

==== CLIC

CLIC <<clic>> is a designated goto for interrupt handling to fulfill everyone needs.
Development took long enough to achieve pre-freeze implementations by some chinese vendors.

Attempts to be an unix capable interrupt controller with horizontal nesting of U, S, H (so far only proposed) and M mode.

All used registers must be saved in software, trampoline handlers need to save all ABI registers.

Preemption is handled in software by special CSR mechanism, that requires extra boilerplate
code in every interrupt handler. Even in "inline" handlers.

Highest priority inline handlers should possible to be made similar to legacy ones.

Introduces unavoidable jitter due to:

- blocks of code executed with disabled interrupts (additive jitter)
- late arrival handled through mnxti read (subtractive jitter of entry time)
- tail chaining handled by another mnxti read (and extra branch) in epilogue
- indirect jump instruction to actual code (branch prediction)

assuming 1 cycle per instruction, 10.2 and 11.1 listings from clic spec <<clic>> offer:

- `entry + 6` cycles of jitter from "inline" handlers.
- `entry + 7 + 16` cycles of jitter from "C-ABI" trampoline entry
- `4 + exit` or `abs(entry - 7)` cycles of jitter from  "C-ABI" trampoline epilogue

NOTE: the trampoline doesn't need to stack all of the 16 caller saved registers before enabling
interrupts, but this exact code is about to be pushed down your throat anyway.

NOTE: according to <<clicentrycycles>>, handler entry time is 6 cycles on sifive E2 and
10 cycles in E3/5

NOTE: BTW, my prediction is that the "competitor A" will be able to do a 
"comparison against riscv" without resorting to FUD tactics, right after CLIC is ratified

==== emb-riscv

emb-riscv <<embriscv>> is clean sheet design that attempts to be universal solution 
for every microcontroller. Designed with a strong focus on RTOS support.

NOTE: Currently development is stalled due to "not encouraging general interest"

Achieves lower interrupt latency by introducing EABI with reduced
amount of caller-saved registers. FP registers are handled by lazy stacking.

Introduces interrupt priority threshold masking.

mandates 4 64bit timers (even on RV32):

- cycle counter
- instret counter
- system timer
- rtc timer

==== CLINT

Attaches to generic interrupt scheme.

According to <<clint>>, it provides memory mapped interface for timers and IPI.

NOTE: ofiicial CLINT is callet ACLINT but doesn't differ much from CLINT in sifive documentations.

==== generic riscv interrupts as described in "privileged" volume II 

Very often refered to as CLINT. e.g. <<sififeintcookbook>> claims that volume II 
stuff is CLINT exclusive.

has vectored mode which simply jumps to the position in vector table.

Doesn't provide any nesting other than privilege levels
Registers and CSR state (`fcsr` etc.) have to be pushed by software before use

==== PLIC/AIA

<<plic>>, <<aia>>

A heavyweight frontend for delivering interrupts to multiple cores 
running typical unix OS. Not suitable for microcontrolers.

claim/complete architecture

handlers stay very similar to generic case.

==== CH32 PFIC

Proprietary design by WCH build on top of generic riscv privileged <<qingkev2>>, <<qingkev3>>, <<qingkev4>>.

The descriptions of a lot of functional behaviour feel like a copy-paste of risc-v privileged.
Highly under/undocumented. +
e.g. There is nothing about what happens to `mepc`, `mcause` or `mstatus` during nesting (especially on "V2" core). +
It is also unknown whether `ra` register doesn't have an additional use (like saving `mepc`...) during 
interrupt entry/exit and connot be used immediately as the currently implemented gcc attribute treats
those functions the same way as the regular ABI ones with `mret` based return. +
Which of course is inline with typical chinese documentation standards.

The vendor provided headers, of course, contain 46 instances of "NVIC" string and just 5 for "PFIC"

Introduces HW stacking or single cycle register shadowing (aka HPE).
It is of course necessary to use custom tuoolchain that implement a "proprietary" attribute:
`\\__attribute__\((interrupt("WCH-Interrupt-fast")))`

NOTE: without <<prestacked annotation>> there will be no portable way of doing this without compilers build
on custom patches. Naked handler + mret trick doesn't work in llvm, it should break in gcc anyway due to
eventual use of callee saved registers and stack.

There is also under/undocumented "EABI enable" bit in `INTSYSCR` on "V2" core.
Most probably it reduces number of HW stacked registers to match the official EABI proposal <<riscveabi>>.

==== PicoRV32 interrupts

> Note: The IRQ handling features in PicoRV32 do not follow the RISC-V Privileged ISA specification.
> Instead a small set of very simple custom instructions is used to implement IRQ handling with minimal hardware overhead.

Original author of the PicoRV found the riscv-privileged to be too heavy for minimal core,
and provided own <<picorvint>> interrupt scheme.

NOTE: FPGA minimum cores, is a non goal for this spec

==== ti c2000 (main core)

Proprietary TI architecture <<spru430f>> sporting an ancient looking accumulator-memory architecture 
(with 8 pointer registers), similar to the classic CISCs. An x86 of motor control and signal processing.
FPU <<spruhs1c>> is more RISC-ish with a bit of VLIW in some instructions.

NOTE: TI is very hesitant to release any general purpose benchmark scores (speed/size etc.) 
<<c2000coremark>>, <<c2000dhrystone>>. Claiming that their architecture "is optimized for
real world control applications". Those kind of scores are also almost non existent in independent sources.

According to <<spraan9a>>, the core automatically saves some of the registers, rest must be pushed
in software. +
"High priority" interrupts can also save and restore all 8 floating point registers into shadow
registers using special instructions. +
There are also 5 (4 in prologue) defacto useless instructions for aligning stack and setting "C28 modes"

To allow nesting of "low priority" interrupts handlers must include extra boilerplate code to
handle prioritiy masking in software. (8 instructions in prologue, 3 in epilogue)

As a consequence there is 21 cycles of jitter and 43 (HPI) or 63 (LPI) cycles of interrupt latency in worst case.

Use of RPT istruction will introduce even more jitter and latecy as the sequence is uninterruptible
and takes arbitrary numbers of cycles to execute.

NOTE: ISR entry latency is 10 cycles due to 8 stage pipeline and automatically stacking 13 registers.
<<c2000workshop>> suggests that the latency is 14 cycles for internal signals.

=== overwiew/discussion of some concepts/features

==== whole app must be doable in C/C++

In this case interrupts must always push all caller saved registers to be able to use functions without 
`\\__attribute__\((interrupt*))` annotation. Leading to <<ABIs with less caller saved registers>>

NOTE: those are usually wrapped with `extern "C"` anyway

It also requires preinitialized table with pointer to startup code, `sp`, `gp`, and of course
any other addition like Zcmt `JVT` csr.

This table is also not necessarily smaller than software setup, e.g. `sp` can be usually
done with single `lui` instruction.

There is still a risk of corruption if the compiler decides to reorder something before
initialization of `.data`/`.bss` sections.

Such startup code is also inefficient as it will have to obey the ABI (spill `ra` to stack) and 
compilers can't optimize out link time symbols anyway. (even though some can be assumed to
always be at certain offsets from 0x00000000 or each other)

Of course I often find that there is a competition on who will make
the worst startup code in assembly. 
So pure C/C++ startup code turns out to be "better" due to confirmation effect.
But let's have a look at my "combotablecrt" implementation <<combotablecrt>> for stm32f030x4/6. 
Is your compiler able to do that?

There is also a case of interrupt handlers that are using only a few registers
and don't need to take latency of the whole ABI/EABI.

==== ABIs with less caller saved registers

The rationale of introducing ABIs with reduced number of caller saved registers is to 
reduce interrupt latency. 

The major downside of such approach is lowered overall performance 
and code denisty. Which is highly unliked across riscv community <<bhvseabi>> and stalls 
development of such (E)ABI.

> I think for marketing reasons we should have the RISC-V EABI mimic the competitor ABI as 
> closely as possible, and be available and supported by the tools, even if almost no-one 
> should end up actually using it.

Zcmp[e] was also prepared for such fragmentation by reserving first 4 points in rlist for EABI,
so the cores can implement UABI and EABI push/pop instructions at the same time.
Those 4 points are of course supposed to handle 20 caller saved regs of EABI (probably with some 
reuse of few higher points).

It will also make the processors capable of stacking 2 registers per cycle, underutilized
during HW stacking due to shorter stacking time than pipeline refill.

An alternative is to provide interrupts with defacto customizable ABIs by e.g. <<prestacked annotation>>
(to match the HW stackers) and handle the function call pressure by <<IPRA - Inter procedural register allocation, IPRA>>.

==== "you are better off with soft stacking in inline handlers"

aka generic riscv `\\__attribute__\((interrupt))`

The major issue lies within the principles of hardware stackers.

When entering interrupt handler, the core first fetches the entry from vector table and then
jumps to that address. Both of those fetches can hit a flash waitstate or a cache miss.
During that operation the data bus remains idle waiting for a first store instruction to be executed.

Those cycles can be accomodated for a "free" stacking of registers. If a higher amount of
registers is stacked then it can hide a bit of jitter coming from cache misses or flash waitstates.

Even stacking by the special push instructions (e.g. XTheadInt <<thead>> or
PUSHINT <<pushint>> and maybe a subsets of those), won't help much. Those start pushing
after the latency of double (waitstated) miss was taken.

The only situation when soft stacking yields better results is when HW stacker has to push 
way more registers than is actually used.

NOTE: Zcmp[e] doesn't cover caller saved registers except `ra`.

==== EABI for RVE must be subset of RVI EABI.

To be able to call RVE only code from RVI ABI +
Recurrig thing in RVE ABI proposals.

The idea is to allow compilers and software vendors to provide a single
set of precompiled libraries for RVI and RVE ABIs.

The issue with this approach is that the code arbitrarily compiled for RVE 
might turn out to be less efficient than RVI one. It also limits the capabilities
of RVI ABI like trading off argument registers for temporary/saved ones.

==== one universal standard for everyone use cases

Having one universal solution for all possible scenarios
brings a lot of inefficiency to all of them. Due to mandatory 
support for a lot of useless functionality, or just the need 
to keep compatibility with useless legacy.

==== special handler return pattern

aka "HANDLER_RETURN" on emb-riscv and "EXC_RETURN" on ARM

The idea is to put special pattern in `ra` during handler entry and
exit by reusing regular return mechanism provided by the ABI. Requires 
certain memory area to be non executable (e.g. 0xF0000000 - 0xFFFFFFFF)

This mechanism follows the typical ABI function call and together with HW 
stacking, allows the interrupt handlers to be a regular C functions.

The downside is that the `ra` and `pc` both have to be pushed onto stack
and in some specifc cases, it could add extra stall cycles after the tail due
to the waitstates/cache miss caused by delayed prefetch.

Alternatively we can just stack the `ra` and put there current `pc` with lowest bit set 
to trigger handler return operation. One less register counted towards interrupt latency.

NOTE: normally the `jalr` instruction just ignores the LSB bit of resulting address.
LSB in register and immediate will lead to "bogus" jump over 2 extra bytes.
Even though this behaviour simplifies hardware, it was oversighted in ABI design 
by allowing "auxiliary information" in pointers as well as `jalr` 
immediate, effectively making both useless.

==== vector tables that are jumped to

It's simply inefficient in truly vectored scenario.
The vector entries will have to be populated with jump instructions anyway.
Those have to take the second round of waitstates/cache miss without amortization by register stacking.

And if the code is far away from vector table (e.g. in SRAM for more deterministic execution),
compiler will have to emit a jump island, aka "veener", that will perform yet another unamortized jump.
allocating 8 bytes per entry and enforcing `lui` + `jalr` sequence will severly trump the 
code density and performance in typical use scenarios.

NOTE: 8051 allocated 8 bytes per entry, but it was able to sometimes fit entire handler or
one of the conditional path. Especially when following entries were unused. This kind of 
optimizations is exlusive to assmebly programming and not practised today.

==== MMIO vs CSR mapped config registers

In case of mass initialization MMIO could result in better code density
CSR space is also limited.

My take is that anything architecturally coupled to the core should reside 
in CSR space and keep the rest in MMIO.

Nothing should exist as both.

==== "reduced/zero jitter"

Very often claimed, yet those claims rarely meet with reality.

NOTE: There are also many non-architectural sources of jitter like caches, waitstated
flash or accessing peripherals in different clock domains (usually divided from sysclk),
DMA contention etc.

Cortex-m0 offers a "zero jitter" by optional IP configuration that adjusts the best case 
of interrupt latency by extra cycle to acommodate random stall from bus contention.

Cortex-m3/4 offer up to 6 cycles of jitter due to "late arrival" and "pop pre-emption".
Regular handler entry is dominated by stacking registers, giving some headroom for extra
vector/instruction fetch latency.

Cortex-cm7 of course suffers from Proprietary&Confidential syndrome. 
Most probably it's similar to cm3/4.

In case of C2000 CLA, TI claims <<spracs0a>>,<<ticladocs>>,<<ticladevguide>> that their task driven machine 
(non preemptible) "reduces interrupt latency and jitter" compared to classic CPU, even
though it does exactly the opposite when there is more than 1 async interrupt to handle.

NOTE: Of course whenever TI compares CLA to "classic cpu", it's always a cpu with preemption 
priorities only and background task not present on CLA. As if the similar "task machine" couldn't
be achieved by regular cpu (e.g. risc-v) without nesting and WFI loop (or "sleep on exit" feature)
giving access to all GPRs in interrupts without stacking.

==== "everything will run Linux in future"

The Linux cargo cult. +
Because a simplest tasks suitable for bunch of 555&74s or a simple microcontroler with a 
few KiB of flash and RAM must be done under linux so it will work somehow "better".

To be able to properly run linux you need quite beefy cpu with a proper MMU, 2-4MiB of flash, 
4-8MiB of RAM (usually external DRAM), long boot time and a bad power consumption in idle. +
Just to run the OS itself.

One of the the most blatant example is NOMMU linux on stm32f429 with SDRAM that is not cached by cpu.

Of course there are still actual reasons <<emblinux>> to use linux in embedded.

===== RTLinux and hard-realtime

Whenever those rt patches are measured, both the interrupt latency and 
jitter is always given in tens or hundreds of microseconds, not cycles
<<linuxrt1>>,<<linuxrt2>>,<<linuxrt3>>,<<linuxrt4>>.

In some scenarios those numbers are unacceptable. +
As an example, industry standard, FOC current loops close within 5-10us <<brianchavens>>
and in some cases it achieves sub 1us latency <<swpy031>>. On a <200 Mhz controllers.

==== lazy stacking

Lazy stacking allows to skip stacking of FP registers if handler doesn't
touch floating point registers.

The main issue is that all of the caller saved FP registers are saved (execution stalls during push)
onto stack whenever FP instruction is executed even though only a few of the registers are used.

==== 64bit microcontrollers

So far, mostly the application processors used in bare metal.

Use cases for such also have different requirements than
from typical 32bit microcontrollers.

=== required ABI

Ideally we should not change the established ABI to avoid disruption
But definitely get rid of the `tp` register which is overall useless.

==== stack alignment

should be 2x`XLEN`, mandated thorought entire program execution so as to not require
special realignment in interrupts. 

[NOTE] 
====
psABI <<riscvpsabi>> says that:

[quote]
----
stack pointer must remain aligned throughout procedure execution
----

and fails to enforce enforce this anyway:

[quote]
----
Non-standard ABI code must realign the stack pointer prior to invoking standard ABI procedures. The
operating system must realign the stack pointer prior to invoking a signal handler; hence, POSIX
signal handlers need not realign the stack pointer. In systems that service interrupts using the
interruptee’s stack, the interrupt service routine must realign the stack pointer if linked with any
code that uses a non-standard stack-alignment discipline, but need not realign the stack pointer if
all code adheres to the standard ABI
----

====

Major ilp32e issue is that the `addi16sp` instruction works on 16 byte stack increment.
Once the `c.addi` range (-32..+31) is exausted compilers have to chose beetwen
denser code and more efficient use of stack.

Zcmp extension was also designed for 16 byte aligned stack. There is Zcmpe extension 
postponed to the future which should handle the EABI. Lowering the stack alignment
requires doubling (per bit of alignment) waste of codepoints by `push`/`pop` instructions.

NOTE: `addi8sp` won't be neccesary as Zcmpe `push`/`pop` can prepare initial 8 byte
allocation for an (optionally) following `addi16sp`

NOTE: 2x`XLEN` alignment allows more optimal use of
microarchitectures capable of stacking 2 registers per cycle

==== interface

JTAG uses too many pins

best would be
1 wire hanging off reset (cannot attach to running target until reset disabled)
like avr updi

=== tooling issues to solve

==== prestacked annotation

Currently there is no universal solution to indicate which registers in interrupt handlers
can be freely used without stacking them.

- `\\__attribute__\((interrupt))` makes all registers callee saved and uses mret to return.
- `\\__attribute__\((interrupt("SiFive-CLIC-preemptible")))` extends regular interrupt by CLIC preemption
- `\\__attribute__\((interrupt("WCH-Interrupt-fast")))` requires custom build toolchain and is bound 
to selected ABI by `-mabi=` command line parameter, still uses mret
- Or just a plain C function that requires prestacking of all caller saved registers, reuses standard 
return mechanism to exit interrupt context

Even worse there are already hardware stackers designed for ilp32e and ilp32. When the new and better 
ABI will be introduced, it will be impossible to use with pre-existing HW stackers. The same applies 
to creating HW stackers that stack less registers to optimize interrupt latency.

Therefore we need universal way to annotate which registers are available for use in a given function
as a defacto calller saved one (aka create custom calling convention)

- `prestacked("")` attribute
- no whitespaces in string parameter
- register range cover all registers between and including specified (`x4-x6` is equivalent to `x4,x5,x6`)
- registers/ranges are separated by comma
- CSRs taking part in calling conventions are also subject to this mechanism
- must use raw names instead of ABI mnemonics as to make it ABI agnostic (more portable)
- registers must be be sorted (integer, floating point, vector, custom, then by lowest numbered)
- CSRs must be put after the architectural regfiles, those don't have to be sorted
- must not collide with `\\__attribute__\((interrupt))` as to support "legacy" handler return mechanisms
- for interop with <<IPRA - Inter procedural register allocation, IPRA>>, unnammed custom CSRs 
also have to be covered. e.g. `csr:0x801` or `csr:0x803-0x811` for a range

psABI caller saved:

`\\__attribute__\((prestacked("x5-x7,x10-x17,x28-x31")))`

Simplified range (e.g. shadow register file):

`\\__attribute__\((prestacked("x8-x15")))`

psABI with floating point, caller saved:

`\\__attribute__\((prestacked("x5-x7,x10-x17,x28-x31,f0-f7,f10-f17,f28-f31,fcsr")))`

ch32v003 irq (ilp32e + PFIC HW stacker, assuming `ra` doesn't have some undocumented use)

`\\__attribute__\((interrupt, prestacked("x1,x5-x7,x10-x15")))`

NOTE: unannotated `ra` is assumed as a valid return address, otherwise a special return mechanism must be
used

===== optimization for `noreturn` functions

gcc/llvm compilers can purge the epilogue (even down the call tree) by automatic 
detection of infinite loop or by using `\\__attribute__\((noreturn))` or `__builtin_unreachable()`.

It is not the case on prologues though, leading to waste of stack and codespace in the most typical
embedded scenario of main or thread functions with an infinite loops.

This missing optimization is intentional <<noreturnprologue>> to allow backtracing 
(`abort()` etc.) and throwing exceptions (of course under -fno-exceptions and exception less code)

By abusing the "prestacked annotation" we can get rid of this prologue 
by "prestacking" all of the available registers. +
e.g. `\\__attribute__\((noreturn, prestacked("x1,x4-x31,f0-f31,fcsr")))`

NOTE: addition of `noreturn_nobacktrace_noexcept` attribute is very unlikely, optimizing 
regular `noreturn` attribute is even less.

==== IPRA - Inter procedural register allocation

So far implemented only by llvm <<llvmipra>>. +
Limited to statically linked code. +
There are almost no benchmarks results, especially the ones other than x86 at -O3.

In simple explanation, it makes every function export information about its usage of 
caller saved registers effectively allowing non leaf functions to use caller saved
registers as a callee saved ones. That avoids some of the stacking/spilling leading
to a more efficiet code.

requirements and improvements needed for efficient IPRA:

- this mechanism must cover the CSRs as well as the registers (e.g. `fcsr`, `vtype`, `vl` etc.)
- custom registers and CSRs should also be covered (e.g. HW loops)
- compilers need to avoid using more registers than necessary (currently no reason)
- registers from compressible range should be allocated only when it will benefit
code density (currently no reason)
- to avoid regression, compilers need some kind of heuristic to detect when stacking
certain (compressible) callee saved registers would yield better code density than using
more temporaries from non compressible ranges

NOTE: on riscv it's `s0` and `s1`, in presence of Zcmp[e] pushing `s0,s1` is free 
in non leaf functions, and just 2 16bit instructions in leaf. With IPRA it should be also
possible to just move `ra` and `s0/s1` into caller saved regs.

NOTE: This is also non IPRA optimization (-Oz kind)

- need special assembly directive to annotate such exports from pure assembly code (workaround exist
<<applying IPRA to assembly functions>>)

NOTE: automatic detection is not an option due to self constructed instructions:
[source, asm]
```
.word (0b0000000<<25)|(8<<20)|(0<<15)|(0b001<<12)|(10<<7)|0x43 
.insn i CUSTOM_1, 0x0, 1, a0, 0x123 
//equivalent to:
//tio.add0.xy a0, y0, s0
//tio.addi0.yx y1, a0, 0x123 
```

- precompiled libraries should also do an "IPRA exports"
- very important point is resolving IPRA annotations of callbacks, where the callback call 
will use the smallest common regmask of all functions that can be called through this point
** callbacks initialized once at startup (typical in many HALs)
** callbacks passed as function parameters
** queues (of structs) with callbacks

NOTE: callbacks are commonly used in peripheral interrups, therefore it's important to
apply IPRA optimizations to those as well

- it can be used to annotate that passed function arguments (through registers or stack) were 
not modified and can be recycled by caller (e.g. in loops)
- it can also "export" list of deterministic constants (and addresses) that are left in registers
after return

NOTE: This mechanism is portable to other architectures, the more caller saved registers are
available, the higher relative gain is.

NOTE: vector extension can benefit from IPRA as current psABI makes all vector registers
temporary, though the syscall destroy entire state

===== adjusting ipra wrt prestacked registers

Because the HW stackers (used with <<prestacked annotation>>) will prefer to stack out the
compressible registers first, it might not be the best match for IPRA optimized allocation

NOTE: compilers usally don't care about non-abi (interrupt) prologues/epilogues and
emit code as if it was the regular ABI function

The solution could be:

- optimize HW stacker for typical allocations
- make compilers treat specially a call trees growing from interrupt handlers
- trump the general IPRA optimizations to use `a0-a5` first

Handlers that are not calling another functions should be straightforward as long as the compiler
allocators/optimizers are not going to straight out ignore <<prestacked annotation>>.

===== applying IPRA to assembly functions

First option as proposed by original author of llvm IPRA iplementation, was the
special attribute to annotate function declaration in header associated with assembly code

e.g. `\\__attribute__\((regmask("clobbered list here")))`

- It Wasn't implemented upstream.

The other option is to use inline asm clobbers to make call to such funcions

[source, C]
```
	__attribute__((always_inline))
	static inline int weird_call(int n, void* p)
	{
		register int result asm("a0") = n;
		register void* a1 asm("a1") = p;

		asm volatile(
			"call foo \n\t"
			: [ARG0] "+r" (result) // return in same register
			: [ARG1] "r" (a1)
			: "memory", "ra", "a2" // use clobber for any caller saved regs used
		);

		return result;
	}
```

- requires the `call` pseudoinstruction that expands to a proper sequence.
Otherwise we get errors when calling too far or missing optimization when short call can be made.
- works in existing compilers (at least in gcc and llvm)

=== startup behaviour



// up to the bootloader to redirect?? `teic_irq_vect` to actual application entry point
// note: app faults should not land in the bootloader handlers
// note: some bootloaders are starting the application y performing full system reset after 
// reconfiguring boot options

==== reset state of registers

The reset state of all architectural registers is undefined unless explicitly specified
in specific extension.

NOTE: That means the reset state of integer, fp, and vector registers is undefined. 

=== interrupts

level triggered

irq number is the position in vector table 
// no need for offseting like in arm

higher irq number - higher priority

stack pointer is not realigned, if stack is not 8 byte aligned 
the behaviour is implementation specified

NOTE: typical HW won't care about 4 byte stack, some dual issuers or hardened cores
might want to enter `Unrecoverable_NMI`

NOTE: Zcmp similarly doesn't specify the required alignment.

==== interrupt entry

==== interrupt exit

==== NMI interrupts

===== NMI unrecoverable state

nested NMI or directly entering `Unrecoverable_NMI` handler

sets 

===== NMI lockup state

//tripple fault??

Whenever
attempt to return from `Unrecoverable_NMI` handler 

exception ?? occuring within `Unrecoverable_NMI` 

halts any further code execution, except the one within the debug mode

NOTE: it is necessary to allow debugger to read out state of registers/memory
after experiencing lockup state.

NOTE: experiencing exceptions within (or return from) unrecoverable handler means a 
serious issue with control flow, where further attempts to execute code would do 
more harm than halting until watchdog performs system reset.  

NOTE: lack of tripple fault lockout can also lead to security vulnerabilities <<nvidiamtveccve>>

|====

NOTE: alignment requirement allows to avoid the additional adder circuit during irq dispatch

NOTE: If vector table consists of 100 entries total, 4 byte each. Then minimum required alignment is 512 bytes

NOTE: `vect_offset` can be implemented with enough state to point at existing memory areas only,
as to reduce necessary state to implement.

NOTE: Implementations may impose additional alignment requirement

NOTE: `vect_offset` can also be implemented as a read only constant pointing to beggining of the flash memory

Otherwise read and write operations on this register are undefined.
|====

//list somewhere mandatory csrs to save??

NOTE: Altough optional, the ability to interrupt multicycle instructions is especially
important for cores implementing zero jitter features.
As an example the ratified Zcmp `cm.popretz` intruction has 3 uninterrupible instructions (one is branch).
Even though it could be just 2 according to common sense and normative Tariq response <<popretzloadzero>>.
It should be already obvious what will be formally pushed down your throat.

NOTE: designated to allow an efficient context switch from the lowest priority interrupt

NOTE: As the risc-v doesn't have condition codes for branching/predication, it is
expected that the smallest implementations will not make use of `estate` register at all.

NOTE: due to maximum 5-level nesting and limited state to preserve, it was decided
to not push previous state onto stack, that would increase interrupt latency.

==== d



=== MMIO TEIC registers

private to the hart

==== sys/hart reset req?

//key+req of hart/sys reset
//deep sleep?

=== additional optional subextensions

==== XteicMP

additional per vector entry interrupt enable

multi hart or when peripheral interrupt lines are shared across multiple cores


==== XteicTinyIrqTable

Makes each address entry in irq vector table take only 2 byte in size.

The top 16 bit of the effective addres are substituted with the top 16 bits of 
`TEIC_ENTRY_VECT_BASE` implementation constant

The `TEIC_ENTRY_VECT_BASE` must be 64KiB aligned.

The entry encoding with least significant bit set, is reserved.

NOTE: Extension designated for smallest devices where a vector table has a more 
significant impact on code memory.

NOTE: SRAM can be used for enplacing handlers if mapped within the same 64KiB block

==== XteicTinyIrqTableExt

//adds csr upper


NOTE: It is possible to implement this on devices with large flash memories
and resort to compiler tricks to keep handlers within within 64KiB ranges.
But the gains will be relatively low, even at a total of 256 vector entries.


== auxiliary extensions

Additional extensions that are usefull addition to xteic

=== Xfenceiext

Because J extension group is going to simply ignore the fact that `fence.i` instruction
allocated whole 22.125 bits of opcodes, and introduce a new instructions for operational
subset of `fence.i` (e.g. `IMPORT.I`) <<zjid1>>,<<zjid2>>. We don't need to care about eventual 
sync with Zjid encodings.

The rationale is that the `fence.i` encodes whole instruction side synchronization with all zero immediate.
Therefore we can remove all of the sync mechanisms by inverting the bits, other than the one designated for
certain operation.

The uppermost 4 bits remain zero to allow enabling extra features not covered by `fence.i`.

==== teic.fence.ipipe

Flushes the pipeline and prefetch buffers before executing next instruction. +
Encoded in bit 0 of `fence.i` immediate

NOTE: not suitable for synchronizing with architectural state modifications by
CSR instructions, use `teic.fence.icsrsync` instead

Mnemonic::
```
teic.fence.ipipe
```

Encoding (RV32, RV64)::
[wavedrom, , svg]
....
{reg:[
 { bits: 7, name: 0xf, attr: ['MISC-MEM'] },
 { bits: 5, name: 0x0, attr: ['rd'] },
 { bits: 3, name: 0x1 },
 { bits: 5, name: 0x0, attr: ['rs1'] },
 { bits: 12, name: 0x0fe, attr: ['imm'] },
]}
....

==== teic.fence.icsrsync

Ensures that the following instructions are executed after the architectural state change 
by a preceding CSR instructions (or equivalent) takes effect.
Encoded in bit 1 of `fence.i` immediate

NOTE: In many cases CSR updates don't require full pipeline flush, though it can be implemented
as regular pipeline flush.

NOTE: necessary to sync e.g irq vector table updates wrt following (peripheral) MMIO access

NOTE: <<cv32e40s>> do require fencing after update of `jvt` and `mtvec` 
(even though `jvt` falls into "program order" category)

Mnemonic::
```
teic.fence.icsrsync
```

Encoding (RV32, RV64)::
[wavedrom, , svg]

{reg:[
 { bits: 7, name: 0xf, attr: ['MISC-MEM'] },
 { bits: 5, name: 0x0, attr: ['rd'] },
 { bits: 3, name: 0x1 },
 { bits: 5, name: 0x0, attr: ['rs1'] },
 { bits: 12, name: 0x0fd, attr: ['imm'] },
]}
....

=== Xicsrmz

Implemented similarly to Zicsr with `uimm=0` mapped into -1 constant.

NOTE: `csrrsi`/`csrrci` with `uimm=0` still doesn't write and cause write side effects.

NOTE: This extensions allows to sync `csrrwi` instruction, with some other extensions 
<<XTightlyCoupledIO>>, as to not cause additional immediate formats.

NOTE: `csrrw rd, csr, x0` can still be used to write a zero into csr.

=== Xtolerantcsr

None of the CSR access shall raise an exception.

- Writes to read only CSRs shall be ignored.
- access to unimplemented CSRs as well as higher privilege ones shall cause no side
effects, read a `0` value and have its write ignored

NOTE: `UNIMP` instruction maps to write into `cycle` csr register, so it can 
no longer be used. `c.unimp` remains available which is encoded as all zero.

NOTE: Extension designated for reduction of silicon use, reflects behaviour of
certain privileged csr registers (e.g. `misa`, `mvendorid` etc.) when unimplemented

=== Xmstacklimit

//u stack lim?

throws exception
when `sp` (x1) register is written with value samller than 

NOTE: local arrays can be created on stack and then accessed by pointer passed in working register.
Therefore stacklimit comparison must happen on write to `sp` register

=== XTinyZcmtTable

=== XTinyZcmtTableExt



[appendix]
== context switch on tiny profile


[appendix]
== atomic block on tiny profile

no single bit interrupt enable
use csrrs/c on a mask then restore

[appendix]
== design decisions in tiny profile

=== no cause code

The cause code can be implied from hardcoded vector table position.
Therefore it's redundant. The other issue with cause code is that
it has to be somehow preserved during nesting.

=== no single bit interrupt enable

It would be redundant to the 2/4 bit `irq_msk` nest enables.
Which can be similarly manageed by `csrsi`, `csrci` instructions.

=== no `misa` register

It's useless.

will it tell you if there is Zbb, Zmmul or Zcmt implemented? - no

On embedded targets, HW information about implemented extensions and ability
to enable/disable them, has a rather low value.

=== stacking of floating point and vector registers 

currently ???

Zfinx ???

Those can still be handled by IPRA anyway. 
FP push/pop instruction might be usefull in such case.

=== undefined initial state of architectural registers

It is said that registers have to be zeroed at reset "to protect software from itself" <<cv32regzeroing>>
It doesn't, it just hides bugs until they manifest in the worst possible scenario.
Just like developing and debugging code at -O0.

This kind of use of uninitailized variables is UB in C/C++ and easily detectable by compilers.
Languages like Rust or Ada are supposed to be free from this UB, so there is no need to spend transistors
or code memory for zeroing those. 

NOTE: V extension uses all ones for `tail agnostic` filling just to prevent software relying on
uarch dependent zeroing.

=== little endian only

Why would you want to have big endian loads/stores? +
Probably for handling tasks that compute "network byte order" data which uses big endian representation.

Nice.
So, lets add a big-endian mode (making it configurable at runtime of course), and enjoy 
mandatory endian neutral loads/stores (<<cryptogamsaesneutralloads>>) used by networking 
libraries, because one cannot be sure on which endianess the code will be run.

Just use `rev8` for "network order" data. It's much better than doing endian neutral access.

=== `TEIC_MMIO_CTRL_BASE` address selection

addressable through `c.lui` + offset

=== no separate process stack

only 4 levels of nesting + one returnable nmi

smallest size uc

expected to run rtos less

=== no csr scratch registers

Unlike the big unix machines, the RTOS context can be statically
addressed by `lui` + `addi` sequence.

=== 256 vector entries

can be escaped by single `c.j` instruction

reasonable amount?

=== no per irq pending/enable in base extension

It is simply redundant to the peripherals as well as the core interrupt enables.

Has use case only when the same interrupts are routed to multiple cores.

=== no nmi/exception nesting

Nesting NMIs is easy way to overflow the stack or greatly increase
the worst case in static stack analysis (if there is even a bound)

It also becomes an issue in pure HW state preservation by `estate_nl`.

Normally such condition is very rare and is usually a sign of bad coding or
much more serious hardware issue, that's causing everything to fail at the same moment.

=== no "software interrupts"

aka software trigger in ARM terminology

Designated for triggering unallocated (or unused peripheral) vectors, by writing to
the special `NVIC->STIR` register

However it's rarely used and only "implemented" vectors can be triggered in such 
way (officially 32 entry granularity in ARM case)

NOTE: Even the PendSV is done by setting `ICSR->PENDSVET` bit instead of executing this mechanism.

NOTE: TEIC provides dedicated "peripheral" for handling software (deffered) interrupts

=== no stack realignment upon interrupt entry/exit

This is just a waste of hardware. The ABI should mandate the alignment instead.
If not followed then the code should be aloowed to trap.

NOTE: some architectures, due to legacy codebases, require explicit satck alignment 
instructions which also contribute to interrupt latency/jitter and impact code density. 

=== "zero jitter" only in highest nesting level interrupts

It doesn't make sense to implement "zero jitter" at any other level.
If given interrupt can by interrupted by a higher nesting priority, then it would
no longer be considered a "zero jitter" one.

NOTE: NMIs can still break the "zero jitter" guarantee, though those should
be considered as a rare fault/error condition.

=== only level triggered interrupts

Peripherals usually implement level triggered interrupts. (ie. require clearing trigger source 
by performing certain actions like reading FIFO registers or clearing the status flags)

Sampling edges on GPIO is done by a separate peripheral that turns it into an
level triggered interrupt.

=== no faulting addr register

aka `mtval` which ` is often not impelemnted anyway, even by uarch without unaligned loads/stores support.

Due to the lack of MMU, the memory access exceptions are considered fatal errors anyway.

The faulting address can still be recovered in a more complex way of decompilation of faulting instr.

=== no (default) "legacy" interrupt modes 

Having our cores to boot with "legacy" interrupt modes
- is a waste of silicon
- causes interrupt hole or additional boilerplate code to handle exceptions/NMIs that arrived before setting
up `mtvec` and thus were routed to reset handler entry.

NOTE: There was even an CVE related to uninitialized `mtvec`: <<nvidiamtveccve>>

This also allows us to use vector address with zeroed two lowest bits. 
Which, in some scenarios, allows setup of vector table address with a single `lui` instruction

In cores designated to work in vectored mode, the `mtvec` has the bottom address lines hardwired to 0.
Which leads to large alignment granularity of the unvectored handler (in ch32v003 it's 1KiB). 
Making the unvectored mode handler share entry with startup code or require large alignment.

=== no regular priority reflected in irq status registers

non-nesting priority is used only during irq handler dispatch.
Current priority field would consume additional circuitry to latch in the current 
non-nesting priority.

Use cases other than "informative purposes" are rare.
