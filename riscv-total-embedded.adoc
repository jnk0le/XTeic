This document uses semantic versioning with respect to potential hardware designs. 
Assembly syntax change is a minor increment. Version 1.0.0 is the first publicly released. 
Changes in prior versions are not versioned properly and not tracked in revision history.

Document is written in a way that reduces the duplications as those are hard to maintain.
